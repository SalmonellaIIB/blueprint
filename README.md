# Blueprint

The Blueprint project aims at delivering a full featured library of
high quality graphics and diagrams for *project managers* and *system
desginers*.

It is written as a library for John Hobby's [METAPOST][2]. We can take
advantage of METAPOST declarative language and macro language to
produce high-quality and easy to maintain graphics. It can already
be used to create these technical drawings:

- Milestones diagrams
- Project schedules
- UML component diagrams
- Charts

It is written by Michael Grünewald and is distributed under the
[CeCILL-B][1] license agreement.
